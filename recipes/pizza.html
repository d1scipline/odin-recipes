    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Making a simple homemade pizza starts with preparing a basic dough, followed by adding a flavorful tomato sauce, cheese, and your favorite toppings. After letting the dough rise, you roll it out and top it with a generous amount of mozzarella cheese and sauce. You can customize your pizza with various toppings like pepperoni, vegetables, or even olives. Once baked in a hot oven, the crust becomes crispy and golden, and the cheese melts into a bubbly, gooey perfection. This easy homemade pizza is a fun and delicious meal for any occasion!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2,5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 packet active dry yeast (about 2 ¼ tsp)</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water</li>
        <li>1 cup tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Toppings of your choice (e.g., pepperoni, bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, olives)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the dough: In a bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water. Let it sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes frothy. Add the flour and salt, mixing until a dough forms.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough: Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead it for 5-7 minutes, until smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Let the dough rise: Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover with a cloth, and let it rise for 1 hour or until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven: Preheat the oven to 475°F (245°C).</li>
        <li>Shape the dough: Punch down the dough, then roll it out on a floured surface to your desired size and shape.</li>
        <li>Add toppings: Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the dough, sprinkle with mozzarella cheese, and add your chosen toppings.</li>
        <li>Bake the pizza: Transfer the pizza to a greased baking sheet or pizza stone. Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly.</li>
        <li>Serve: Let the pizza cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy!</li>
