    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>To make a simple lasagna, start by preheating your oven to 375째F (190째C). Cook lasagna noodles according to package instructions, then drain and set aside. In a large skillet, brown 1 lb of ground beef (or turkey) with 1 diced onion and 2 minced garlic cloves. Once browned, stir in 2 cups of marinara sauce, salt, pepper, and a pinch of dried oregano. In a bowl, combine 15 oz of ricotta cheese with 1 beaten egg, 2 cups of shredded mozzarella, and a pinch of salt. To assemble, spread a layer of meat sauce at the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish, followed by a layer of noodles, then the ricotta mixture. Repeat the layers, ending with a final layer of meat sauce and a generous sprinkle of mozzarella on top. Cover with foil and bake for 25 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for another 15 minutes until bubbly and golden. Let the lasagna sit for 10 minutes before serving. Enjoy!</p>
