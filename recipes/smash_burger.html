    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>To make smash burgers, start by dividing 1 lb of ground beef into 4 equal portions and rolling them into loose balls. Season the beef with salt and pepper, then heat a griddle or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, place the beef balls on the griddle and smash them down with a spatula until they are thin and crispy. Cook the patties for about 2-3 minutes, allowing the edges to brown, then flip them and place a slice of cheese on top to melt. Toast the burger buns on the griddle until golden. Assemble the burgers by placing the patties on the buns and adding any optional toppings such as onions, pickles, ketchup, or mustard. Serve hot and enjoy the delicious, crispy smash burgers!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb ground beef (80% lean, 20% fat)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>4 burger buns</li>
        <li>4 slices of cheese (American, cheddar, or your preference)</li>
        <li>1 small onion, thinly sliced (optional)</li>
        <li>Pickles (optional)</li>
        <li>Ketchup and mustard (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your griddle or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. If you're using a flat top grill or pan, make sure it's hot before cooking.</li>
        <li>Divide the ground beef into 4 equal portions (about 4 oz each). Roll them into loose balls.</li>
        <li>Season the beef balls generously with salt and pepper on both sides.</li>
        <li>Place the beef balls onto the hot griddle or skillet. Using a sturdy spatula, smash the balls down immediately until they are thin (about 1/2-inch thick). You can use a second spatula to apply extra pressure if needed.</li>
        <li>Cook the burgers for about 2-3 minutes until the edges start to brown and crisp up. Do not move them around while cooking to maintain the crispy edges.</li>
        <li>Flip the burgers and immediately place a slice of cheese on top. Cook for another 1-2 minutes until the cheese is melted and the burger is cooked to your desired doneness.</li>
        <li>Toast the buns on the griddle for about 1 minute until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Assemble the smash burgers by placing the cooked patties on the toasted buns. Add optional toppings like onions, pickles, ketchup, and mustard.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately and enjoy your delicious smash burgers!</li>
